                <p class="about-me-text text-center">Hello, I'm Jake, a lifelong tech junkie and extreme sports lover. If I'm not on a computer, then I'm on a board or something with an engine. I honestly love doing anything in the great outdoors, and enjoy keeping a balance between being a code crazy, video gaming hermit at home while also getting out and experiencing everything that nature has to offer.</p>

                <p class="about-me-text text-center">My love for tech all started the moment my father had bought me a computer for my birthday at the age of 10, I knew right then and there that it was my future. I started with video games, finding fun tricks in the command prompt, and learning how to navigate my way around an operating system. It turned into figuring out how to diagnose and fix simple issues, or even add mods step by step from other like minded geeks on the internet. To now, having several years of experience in IT, and moving on to my biggest stride forward yet, Web Development.</p> 
                    
                <p class="about-me-text text-center">Working with and understanding code has been quite an adventure, but I've come to feel that one of the most satisfying feelings I've known is having an "Aha!" moment while coding.</p>
